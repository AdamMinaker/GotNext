A medium for basketball players.
The main idea behind this website is to provide a low friction mediumfor basketball players to find other basketball players to compete with on public basketball courts.
This will allow the sport to grow and increase healthy competition which will increase general health and fitness. 
Due to the active nature of basketball players I consider the mobile experience on the site just as important as the desktop experience.
